									<div class="text">
										<p>Since the 1990s, trading with bank instruments is a well-established part
											of the global economy. The world&apos;s largest holding companies
											issue blocks of debt instruments such as <b>Medium Term Notes</b>,
											debentures, and standby letters of credit.
										</p>
										<p>The genesis of this marketplace was the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference,
											attended by 730 delegates of the 44 allied countries of World War II. The
											conference's purpose was to establish a stable system of international
											finance.
											It is the system used today and economic stability is still the impetus
											for the operation of these transactions.
											These transactions started over fifty years ago and they have
											grown and continuously modified to meet modern needs and standards.

									<h4 class="mt-3">Widespread Use of Private Placement Programs</h4>
									<div class="text">
										<p>The Bretton Woods Conference was held on July 1st, 1944, with more than 700
											participants representing 44 countries coming together and advocating for
											the establishment of an international banking system. International leaders
											have decided to adopt the US dollar as the standard global currency for
											international trade. It was backed by gold, which was the most stable
											currency at the time. The adoption of the US dollar as the standard currency
											of international trade was the milestone that triggered the development of
											the banking instrument market.</p>
										<p>To further solidify the universal acceptance of the U.S. Dollar as the
											standard world currency, the Bretton Woods Conference had to fix the price
											of gold backing the U.S. Dollar per ounce. The United States did not possess
											enough gold to continue stabilizing international economic expansion.</p>
										<p>The US Treasury had to find a solution to continue creating US Dollars,
											that’s why it created financial instruments, mainly <b>Medium Term Notes
												(MTN)<sup>*</sup>
											</b>, which were sold to major global banks.</p>
										<p>Once the Federal Reserve cashed out the sale of the financial instruments in
											dollars, they were able to reintegrate into targeted segments of the global
											economy in accordance with the US Treasury and policies determined by the
											G-8 countries.</p>
										<p>The world’s biggest banks exchanged their financial instruments and
											<b>PRIVATE
												PLACEMENT PROGRAMS (PPP)</b> were born. Initially they were only for
											banks and governments, but this market gradually opened up to well-qualified
											individual investors.
										</p>
										<p class="mt-3"><b>* Medium Term Notes</b> are negotiable debt securities that
											accrue
											interest.
											They are issued by governments or companies in international debt
											markets, to finance their medium and long-term capital needs.</p>

									<h4 class="mt-3">What is a Private Placement Program?</h4>
									<div class="text">
										<p><b>Private Placement Programs</b> are high-profit investment programs. They
											are safe,
											private, “invitation only” trading programs for financial instruments
											(especially <b>MTNs</b>) offered by the world's leading banks to help their
											clients
											finance capital investment, expansion, and specific projects.</p>

										<p>Investors first buy these instruments early after issuance
											with a significant discount from their nominal value.
											Afterwards they are sold in the secondary market at a higher price. The
											difference between the purchase and selling prices is the investor's profit.
											PPPs are offered only to customers with
											high purchasing power and such transactions may only be carried out by
											licensed dealers.
										</p>

										<p>For example, you as an individual can agree to loan $100 to a friend with the
											understanding that the interest for the loan will be 10%, resulting in a
											total of $110 to be repaid. Effectively, you have created $10,
											even though that money can not be seen initially.
											Banks do this sort of lending every day, even though the amounts run into
											the
											billions of dollars, with the amounts of interest involved, and potential
											profits in the PPP market, correspondingly higher.
											<b>PPPs</b> involve trading these
											discounted bank-issued debt instruments which defer payment obligations, or
											debts.
										</p>

										<p>The <b>PPP</b> market is changing and it is no longer limited to governments
											and <b>MTNs</b>. It is common practice for large, stable companies of all
											types to issue their own debt instruments.
										</p>

										<p>Every day, the world's major banks issue billions of dollars worth of
											instruments such as <b>Medium Terms Notes (MTN), Bank Guarantees (BG), and
												Stand-By Letters of Credit (SBLC)</b>, many of which are sold
											on the secondary market at discounted prices.</p>

										<p>All trading programs in the <b>PRIVATE PLACEMENT PROGRAM</b> area include
											trading with discounted debt notes. Furthermore, in order to bypass the
											legal restrictions, this trading can only be done on a private level. This
											is the main difference between trading with <b>PPP</b> and "normal" trading,
											which is highly regulated. <b>PRIVATE PLACEMENT</b> level business
											transactions are free from the usual restrictions in the securities market.
											It is based on reliable, essential, special relationships and protocols.
										</p>

										<p>However, none of these programs can be started unless there are sufficient
											funds to support each transaction. The banks need to &ldquo;share the
											wealth&rdquo;
											by allowing private investors to participate in the investment, in order to
											help the bank increase its own investment reach.

									<h4 class="mt-3">Process of Profits of Private Placement Programs </br></h4>
									<div class="text">
										<p>Here is a hypothetical transaction.</p>
									</div>
									<ul>
										<li class="ml-3" style="list-style-type:decimal;">A program accepts 72% of the
											nominal value
											of an <b>MTN</b> (for very large
											quantities, the price may be below 50%) and a sale price of 80% to the
											covenantee. However, the difference of 8% points is not yet the profit of
											the program. This profit is first shared with the <b>Federal Reserve Bank
												(FED)</b> at a rate of 50:50, where deviations are also possible. Then,
											after deducting the bank charges, the program usually shares it with the
											investor at a rate of 30:70, the program takes 30% and the investor takes
											70%. Excluding bank charges, the investor has 2.8% of the nominal value.
											Although your actual investment results vary and depend on the individual
											transaction, these example numbers are all realistic of past transactions.
										<li class="ml-3" style="list-style-type:decimal;">Assuming 40 trading weeks per
											year, the
											investor earns 112% per annum. That
											means, two transactions per week and 224% per year.</li>
										<li class="ml-3" style="list-style-type:decimal;">In fact, in <b>MTN</b> this
											trade is done
											several times a day (3-4 times a
											day or even more) for 40 bank weeks per year. For a total of 40 bank weeks
											of 4 trading days, 2 transactions per 2% commission per transaction, a total
											yield of 640% is derived, based on the capital provided (blocked fund). In
											fact, the total return is higher.</li>
										<li class="ml-3" style="list-style-type:decimal;">The secret lies in the rate of
											turnover,
											that is to say the speed of the
											same investor fund is used and returned repeatedly. Programs that buy back
											property and sell back immediately to export to the secondary market are the
											fastest operating performances.</li>
										<li class="ml-3" style="list-style-type:decimal;">The profits are paid to the
											investors every
											month. The investor determines
											the account to which the revenue will be transferred. Program banks offer a
											discontinuation of revenue for a deduction. The investor is solely
											responsible for the correct taxation of the investment income.</li>
										<li class="ml-3" style="list-style-type:decimal;">The process that we explained
											above is a
											short simplification for illustration purposes. In fact, the
											trade is much more complex.</li>
